# Grade Compute
A simple calculator to compute grades on the basis on internal marks and CGPA as devised by my college MIT Manipal.  
The formula employed is as follows:  
# Total marks = (Internal marks) + (Internal marks X 0.5) + (2.5 X CGPA)  
Legend:  
90 and above: A+  
80-89: A  
70-79: B  
60-69: C  
50-59: D  
40-49: E  
Less than 40: F
